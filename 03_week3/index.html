#### <h1>Week 3: Kinectic sculpture </h1>

   I'd like to build a kinect sculpture similar to the tapping hand installation that I've seen before in a store. 
   I was intriged by its interesting mechanical motion and design concept, but I was also wondering if I could adpat it for making a sound object.

   One problem that I encounter in my previous experience building instruments with motors is their distractive operation noise. 
   For example, when working with a set of solennoid motors, the sound generated by the relay and solennoid can be much louder than the intented instrumental sound. 
   The tapping-hand mechanism would have great potential for making a percussive sound instrument with optimized operation noise.  

   <br>
   <br>
   Since the primary force coming from one stepper motor will need to drive multiple tapping motions, one important task was to find a light weight material that can easily transfer the motor energy to the tapping points or mallets. 
   I also spent a lot of time listening to various materials and experimenting with mouting positions.  

   <br>
   <br>
   Although I did finish a working prototype that can generate tapping sounds with a single stepper motor, but the sound was extremly soft and there was a lot of unexpected friction between different components. The lesson that I learned from this unsuccesful prototype was that gravity and mechanical force are equally imporatant for making a clear and percussive tapping sound. 

   <br>
   <br>
   Unfortunately, I didn't save any documentation from my first prototype and I had to breaked it into parts to build another iteration for week 4. I will need to re-arrange materials from w3/w4 assigments later.
