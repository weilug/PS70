Project idea one : 

<P>
  I'd like to build a touchpad as an interactive interface for one of my current installation projects (as shown in the preview). 
  It was originally developed as a browser-based web app, but now reimagined as a projection installation 
  and scheduled to be physically installed in a gallery exhibition space in Beijing in April. 
  Since the installation explores our current living situation in a digital space through a mouse man avatar, 
  much of our current interaction is developed based on 1. Touch-screen gestures  2. computer mouse input. In the original version.

<br>
<br>

          A desired interactive interface will need to have the following functions: 
    <ul>
      <li> Multi-touch and Pressure-sensitive  (to simulate touch-screen interaction)</li>
      <li> Scroll and drag (to simulate common functions of a computer mouse) </li>
      <li> Advanced expression and gesture control capabilities (to detect more nuanced bodily expression) </li>
</ul>
</P>

Here is an example :

https://bela.io/ -  This example seems to be relevant to my idea, but I'd like to also have both built-in pressure and touch-based interaction. 

Something like this:

Project idea Two : 

<P>
  I plan to write a new piece for solo accordion later this year and am interested in exploring alternative instrumentation with air valves. 
  Originally, I thought about the possibility of hacking a cheap toy accordion with some sensors.
  I found this push/pull project as a greatt example: http://3dmin.github.io/
<br>
<br>

  Possible directions: 
    <ul>
      <li> Push/pull is a custom-made digital instrument that has great potential for future modifications and instrumentation. 
        I'd like to replicate the original version first and then build my own concepts into it. </li>
      <li> Another related air sensor that I might want to integrated into my project  https://www.programmableair.com/ </li>
</ul>
</P>
