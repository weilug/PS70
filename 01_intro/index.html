#### <h1>Week 1: Introduction</h1>
<br>
<br> 
////////////Current Update ////////////// <br>

(work-in-progress)

My original final project plan was to build a touch interface or an augmented accordion. But currently I'm going to combine these two ideas into one. 
In general, I'd like to explore ways to build different gesture-based control mechanisms into a single control interface. 
I'm considering three possibile design directions and am also exploring other possibilites. 

There are some basic functions that I'd like to have in the interface: 
<ul>
  <li> Timbre shaping - four control channels for A(attack) D(delay) S(sustain) R(release) </li>
  <li> Volume control and pitch shifting</li>
  <li> Multiple I/Os - MIDI, USB, Aux </li>
  <li> Networking - Bluetooth, or Wifi module that can communicate through serial and OSC protocol </li>

</ul>


1. Software direction (digital): 


2. Hardware direction (analog): 


3. Hybrid direction (digital + analog): 


In the last few weeks, I did some research on various DIY music interfaces and Toys.  

<br>
<br>
Although I found a great open-source project called Push/Pull to study and hoped that I could replicate and modify it in some ways for my next compostion project. 
But as I start look into their documentation and parts requirements, 
I quickly realize the technical difficulties and the time constraints I have. It turns out that the hardware part is much more complex than I originally expected and it would be very diffilicult to proceed without their specified hardware components.
Specifically, the push/pull interface requires different custom-designed PCB printings and is built with an expensive DSP microcontroller developed by the group. In this case, I would like to spend a bit more time to research before I commit to their hardware architecture.

////////////Initial Ideas////////////// <br>
Project idea one : 

<P>
  I'd like to build a touchpad as an interactive interface for one of my current installation projects (as shown in the preview). 
  It was originally developed as a browser-based web app, but now reimagined as a projection installation 
  and scheduled to be physically installed in a gallery exhibition space in Beijing in April. 
  Since the installation explores our current living situation in a digital space through a mouse man avatar, 
  much of our current interaction is developed based on 1. Touch-screen gestures  2. computer mouse input. In the original version.

<br>
<br>

          A desired interactive interface will need to have the following functions: 
    <ul>
      <li> Multi-touch and Pressure-sensitive  (to simulate touch-screen interaction)</li>
      <li> Scroll and drag (to simulate common functions of a computer mouse) </li>
      <li> Advanced expression and gesture control capabilities (to detect more nuanced bodily expression) </li>
</ul>

Here is an example :

https://bela.io/ -  This example seems to be relevant to my idea, but I'd like to also have both built-in pressure and touch-based interaction. 

Something like this:

Project idea Two : 

<P>
  I plan to write a new piece for solo accordion later this year and am interested in exploring alternative instrumentation with air valves. 
  Originally, I thought about the possibility of hacking a cheap toy accordion with some sensors.
  I found this push/pull project as a greatt example: http://3dmin.github.io/
<br>
<br>

  Possible directions: 
    <ul>
      <li> Push/pull is a custom-made digital instrument that has great potential for future modifications and instrumentation. 
        I'd like to replicate the original version first and then build my own concepts into it. </li>
      <li> Another related air sensor that I might want to integrated into my project  https://www.programmableair.com/ </li>
</ul>
