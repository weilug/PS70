#### <h1>Week 2: Laser Cutting </h1>

Learning 3D modeling in Fusion 360 
<br><br>
I've worked with generative 3D geometry before, but have never tried to manually scuplt a 3D structure from sratch. 
so the learning process for me in this week's assignment has been quite challenging. 
I followed a beginner tutorial sereis to start modeling some simple 3D objects while learning different basic interface functions. 
Hope through this semester and a lot more practice, I can ultimately be able to conceptulzie and model more complex structures on my own.

DIY Electromagnetic mic

<P>
I've been interested in electromagnetic sounds for a while and always wanted to build my microphone.
For the design part, I followed an opensource mic project to gather all the mateirals I need for building it. 
I then used the laser cutter to cut a 3mm thick Arcrylic sheet into different pieces and later assembled them with some M3 screws and spacer.
The circuitry part for this microphone is relatively simple. I just need to solder two ends of a copper wire loop conncted to the two signal channels of a standard XRL microphone cable.
<br> 
<br> 
<br> Here are images from the cutting process. <br>

Here is a video demo showing some random electronic signals captured in a workspace:

<br>
<p> I will probably make some changes in the next iteration:
  <ul>
    <li>more copper wire turns - more copper wires will increase the signal sensitivity </li>
    <li>increase the case size </li>
    <li> add a small gap between the cooper wire loop and the handle so that the cable can be more organized and clean</li>
  </ul>
