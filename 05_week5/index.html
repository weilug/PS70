#### <h1>Week 5: 3D design & printing </h1>
<br>

//////////////Part 1 3D printing//////////// <br> 
<br>
Step 1: Fusion sketch <br>

I followed a youtube tutorial and designed a spaceship. 
<br>

Step 2: export to PrusaSlicer for 3D printing <br>
<br>
I first exported the model as a dtl file and then used PrusaSlicer to generate a G-code file. 
Because the origial model size was too big for a short print, so I had to downsize the model in PrusaSlicer to make it more manageble.
The estimated printing time was about 50min.

<br>
Step 3: First 3D print
<br>

<br> I quickly learned that the contact area between the model and the printing platform has to be flat so that the printing mateiral can stick on the platform. 
So I readjust the design by adding a flat base, and also changed the setting in PrusaSlice to add a supportive base. 


Step 4: reprint <br> <br>

Step 5: The final result <br> <br>
with the base support<br>

without the base<br>

//////////////Part 2 Photogrammetry scan //////////// <br> 
<br>
I used Polycam app on my Iphone 13 to scan a trash can and a outdoor chair. (I can only export video file with the free version)
I have subscribed it before and used it for a few projects. The software works better with smaller objects and a balanced lighting condition. I tried to scan a larger space, but the results were not ideal. 
It seems to have a built-in filter function to clean some noise. For future direction, I would like to explore ways to post-processing Photogrammetry mesh and/or have access to all the indivisual points information.
